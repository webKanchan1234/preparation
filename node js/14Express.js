// Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies the process of setting up a server and handling HTTP requests.


// ----------------------difference between node js and express js-------------------
// Node.js and Express.js are both key technologies in the JavaScript ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and have distinct roles in web development. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison to help understand their differences:

// 1. definition
// Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine used in Google Chrome.
// Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction over Node.js, simplifying the process of building web applications and APIs.

// 2. features
// Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.
// Express.js uses middleware to handle HTTP requests. Middleware functions can be used for tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, etc.
