//--------------------------------node js
// Node.js is a popular runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of a web browser. Here’s an overview of its key features, use cases, and benefits:

// Key Features
// Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications that require high throughput.
// Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable: Node.js operates on a single thread using event looping, which can handle multiple connections concurrently. This contrasts with traditional server models that use multiple threads to handle requests.
// NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world. It makes it easy to share and reuse code.
// Cross-Platform: Node.js is cross-platform and can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.





////--------------------------------how node js works
// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is designed to build scalable network applications and allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting. Here’s a detailed look at how Node.js works:

// Event-Driven Architecture
// Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, which means that it operates on an event loop. This non-blocking I/O model makes it lightweight and efficient, ideal for applications that need to handle many concurrent connections.

// Event Loop: The event loop is the core mechanism of Node.js. It is a single-threaded loop that waits for events and processes them. When an event occurs (like a request coming to a server), it triggers the corresponding callback function.

// Non-blocking I/O: Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, allowing the event loop to continue running other tasks while waiting for operations like file reading, network communication, or database queries to complete. This ensures that the system remains responsive.

// Asynchronous Programming
// Node.js promotes asynchronous programming, where operations do not wait for others to complete before starting. Instead, callbacks, promises, and async/await are used to handle the completion of operations.
// Callbacks: Functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed after the completion of certain operations.
// Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.
// Async/Await: Syntactic sugar over promises, making asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, improving readability and maintainability.
// Single-Threaded but Scalable
// Although Node.js runs on a single thread, it can handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently thanks to its event loop and non-blocking I/O. For CPU-intensive tasks, it can leverage child processes or worker threads to avoid blocking the main thread.



//------------------node js single threaded, then how handle concurrency
// Node.js is indeed single-threaded, but it effectively handles concurrency through its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations. Here's a detailed explanation of how Node.js manages to handle many concurrent operations despite running on a single thread:

// Event Loop
// The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that manages asynchronous operations. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, enabling it to handle multiple concurrent requests without being blocked.

// How the Event Loop Works
// Event Queue: Node.js maintains an event queue where events are queued up. These events could be anything like incoming HTTP requests, file I/O operations, timers, etc.

// Event Loop: The event loop continuously checks the event queue for new events. When an event is detected, the loop processes it by executing the associated callback function.

// Callbacks: The callback functions are small pieces of code that get executed when an event completes. Instead of waiting for the event to complete (blocking the thread), Node.js registers the callback and continues executing other code.

// Non-blocking I/O: When an I/O operation is initiated (like reading a file or querying a database), Node.js starts the operation and immediately moves on to the next task. Once the I/O operation is completed, it places a callback function in the event queue to handle the result.

// Asynchronous Operations
// Node.js promotes the use of asynchronous programming to handle concurrency. Here are the main tools used:

// Callbacks: Functions that are passed as arguments to asynchronous operations and are executed once the operation completes.
// const fs = require('fs');

// fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
//     if (err) {
//         console.error(err);
//         return;
//     }
//     console.log(data);
// });

// Promises: Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, allowing chaining of operations.
// const fs = require('fs').promises;

// fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8')
//     .then(data => {
//         console.log(data);
//     })
//     .catch(err => {
//         console.error(err);
//     });

// Async/Await: Syntactic sugar over promises, providing a way to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.
// const fs = require('fs').promises;

// async function readFile() {
//     try {
//         const data = await fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8');
//         console.log(data);
//     } catch (err) {
//         console.error(err);
//     }
// }

// readFile();


//-------------------------blocking  I/O syncronous
// Blocking I/O operations in Node.js are synchronous, meaning they stop the execution of the program until the operation is completed. This can lead to performance issues, especially in a single-threaded environment like Node.js, because while the program is waiting for the blocking I/O operation to complete, it cannot perform any other tasks.


//--------------------------//non-blocking  I/O asyncronous
// Non-blocking I/O in Node.js refers to the ability to initiate I/O operations and continue executing other tasks while waiting for the operations to complete. This is achieved through asynchronous programming, which is fundamental to Node.js's architecture. Here's how non-blocking I/O and asynchronous programming work in Node.js:


//----------------how node is different from others backend like php, dotnet, etc
// Node.js differs from other backend technologies like PHP and .NET in several key ways, including its architecture, concurrency model, programming language, ecosystem, and typical use cases. Here’s a detailed comparison:

// 1. Architecture
// Node.js:

// Event-Driven and Non-Blocking I/O: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This allows it to handle many concurrent connections efficiently with a single thread using an event loop.
// Single-Threaded: Node.js operates on a single thread for handling event-driven, non-blocking tasks, but it can use multiple threads for CPU-bound tasks via worker threads or child processes.

// 2. Concurrency Model
// Node.js:

// Event Loop and Callbacks: Utilizes an event loop for handling asynchronous operations. Callbacks, promises, and async/await are used to manage asynchronous code.
// High Throughput: Efficiently handles I/O-bound tasks with high concurrency due to its non-blocking nature.



//--------------------difference bt async parallel and async series
// When working with asynchronous operations, you often need to manage multiple tasks that can either be executed in parallel or in series. Understanding the difference between these two approaches is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring correct behavior in your applications. Here’s a detailed explanation of async parallel and async series, along with examples:

// Async Parallel
// Async parallel refers to executing multiple asynchronous operations at the same time. In this approach, all tasks are initiated concurrently, and the final result is collected when all tasks complete.

// Key Characteristics:
// Concurrency: All tasks run concurrently, without waiting for any other task to complete.
// Performance: Can significantly reduce total execution time if tasks are I/O-bound and can be performed concurrently.
// Independence: Tasks are independent and do not depend on the completion of other tasks.


// Async Series
// Async series refers to executing multiple asynchronous operations one after the other, in a sequential manner. Each task starts only after the previous task has completed.

// Key Characteristics:
// Sequential Execution: Tasks are executed one after the other.
// Dependency Management: Useful when tasks depend on the results of previous tasks.
// Increased Total Time: The total execution time can be longer compared to parallel execution since each task waits for the previous one to complete.



// ----------------------promise all and promise settled
// Promise.all and Promise.allSettled are both methods in JavaScript that handle multiple promises concurrently, but they have different behaviors and use cases. Here’s a detailed comparison of the two:

// Promise.all
// Promise.all is used to run multiple promises concurrently and returns a single promise that resolves when all the input promises have resolved or rejects as soon as any of the input promises rejects.

// Characteristics:
// Resolution: Resolves when all input promises resolve.
// Rejection: Rejects immediately if any input promise rejects.
// Return Value: Resolves to an array of the results of the input promises, in the same order as the promises passed.
// Use Case:
// When you need all promises to complete successfully, and a failure in any promise should stop the entire operation.


// Promise.allSettled
// Promise.allSettled is used to run multiple promises concurrently and returns a single promise that resolves when all input promises have settled (either resolved or rejected).

// Characteristics:
// Resolution: Resolves when all input promises have settled.
// Rejection: Never rejects, even if some of the input promises reject.
// Return Value: Resolves to an array of objects, each representing the outcome of each promise (either { status: "fulfilled", value: ... } or { status: "rejected", reason: ... }).
// Use Case:
// When you need to know the outcome of all promises regardless of whether they resolve or reject, and you want to handle each result individually.

// -------------------------diff bt npm and yarn
