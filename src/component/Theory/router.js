// React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with what's being displayed on the page.



// --------------------how to manage nested routes in terms of role based--------
// Managing nested routes in a React application in terms of role-based access control (RBAC) involves controlling access to specific routes and components based on the user's role or permissions. Here's how you can manage nested routes with role-based access control in a React application:

// Define route configuration: Define your route configuration, including nested routes and their corresponding components. Each route can have a role or permissions property indicating the required role or permissions to access the route.Example:

// const routes = [
//     {
//       path: '/dashboard',
//       component: Dashboard,
//       roles: ['admin', 'user'],
//       routes: [
//         {
//           path: '/dashboard/profile',
//           component: Profile,
//           roles: ['user'],
//         },
//         {
//           path: '/dashboard/admin',
//           component: AdminDashboard,
//           roles: ['admin'],
//         },
//       ],
//     },
//     {
//       path: '/login',
//       component: Login,
//     },
//     // Other routes...
//   ];
  

// Implement route guarding: Implement route guarding logic to protect routes based on the user's role or permissions. You can use higher-order components (HOCs) or render props to conditionally render routes based on the user's role.Example:

// import { Redirect, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

// const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, roles, ...rest }) => (
//   <Route {...rest} render={props => (
//     authService.isAuthenticated() && roles.includes(authService.getUserRole())
//       ? <Component {...props} />
//       : <Redirect to='/login' />
//   )} />
// );

// const App = () => (
//   <Router>
//     {routes.map((route, index) => (
//       <PrivateRoute key={index} path={route.path} exact={route.exact} roles={route.roles} component={route.component} />
//     ))}
//   </Router>
// );

// In this example, the PrivateRoute component guards access to routes based on the user's role. If the user is authenticated and has the required role, the route is rendered; otherwise, the user is redirected to the login page.
// Protect nested routes: Ensure that nested routes inherit the access control rules from their parent routes. This ensures that access to nested routes is determined by the user's role and the permissions required for the parent route.Example:


// const Dashboard = ({ match }) => (
//     <div>
//       <h2>Dashboard</h2>
//       <ul>
//         <li><Link to={`${match.url}/profile`}>Profile</Link></li>
//         <li><Link to={`${match.url}/admin`}>Admin Dashboard</Link></li>
//       </ul>
//       {routes.map((route, index) => (
//         <PrivateRoute key={index} path={`${match.path}${route.path}`} exact={route.exact} roles={route.roles} component={route.component} />
//       ))}
//     </div>
//   );
  

// By defining route configuration with role requirements, implementing route guarding logic, and protecting nested routes, you can effectively manage nested routes in a React application based on role-based access control. This approach ensures that users only have access to routes and components that are approp
