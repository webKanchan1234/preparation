// In React, interceptors are often implemented using middleware or higher-order components (HOCs) to intercept and modify requests or responses at various points in the application's lifecycle. Here are some common use cases for interceptors in React applications:


// Authentication: Interceptors can be used to attach authentication tokens or headers to outgoing requests, ensuring that authenticated users can access protected resources.
// Error handling: Interceptors can intercept error responses from the server and handle them centrally, providing a consistent error-handling mechanism across the application.
// Logging: Interceptors can log information about incoming and outgoing requests, including request headers, request bodies, response statuses, and response bodies, for debugging or monitoring purposes.
// Caching: Interceptors can implement client-side caching mechanisms to cache responses and reduce the number of network requests, improving performance and user experience.
// Request transformation: Interceptors can transform request data before it is sent to the server, such as adding query parameters, modifying request bodies, or converting request formats.
// Response transformation: Interceptors can transform response data before it is processed by the application, such as parsing JSON responses, handling pagination, or normalizing response formats.
