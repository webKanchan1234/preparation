// Debouncing is a strategy used to improve the performance of a feature by controlling the time at which a function should be executed.

// Debouncing accepts a function and transforms it in to an updated (debounced) function so that the code inside the original function is executed after a certain period of time.

// If the debounced function is called again within that period, the previous timer is reset and a new timer is started for this function call. The process repeats for each function call.
