// Java is an object-oriented programming language used in distributed environments on the internet. It is a high-level language that is also easy to read and understand.


// -------------------------features ----------------------------

// Object-oriented: Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code.

// Platform independence: Java programs can run on any platform with a compatible JVM, making it highly versatile.

// Robust: Java is designed to be robust and reliable, with features like automatic memory management (garbage collection) and strong type checking.

// Security: Java has built-in security features to protect against various security threats, such as unauthorized access to resources and malicious code execution.

// Rich ecosystem: Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that support various application development needs, from desktop to web and mobile.


// ----------------------------INDEPENDENT----------------------------------
// Java is considered platform-independent primarily because of its unique approach to code execution and distribution:

// Bytecode Compilation: When you write a Java program, the source code is compiled into an intermediate representation called bytecode instead of native machine code. Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

// JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The bytecode generated by the Java compiler is platform-independent. It's not tied to any specific hardware or operating system. The JVM is responsible for interpreting this bytecode and translating it into native machine code that can be understood and executed by the host system. Each platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) has its own implementation of the JVM, but they all understand and execute the same bytecode.

// Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA): Because Java programs are compiled into bytecode that can be executed on any system with a compatible JVM, developers can write their code once and run it on any platform that supports Java. This eliminates the need for developers to write separate versions of their software for different operating systems.

// Platform-specific Libraries: While the core Java language and libraries are platform-independent, certain tasks like interacting with the file system or GUI elements may require platform-specific code. Java provides mechanisms (like Java Native Interface - JNI) to incorporate platform-specific code when necessary, but the majority of the code remains platform-independent.

// Overall, Java's platform independence is achieved through a combination of bytecode compilation, the JVM, and a commitment to providing a consistent development environment across different platforms. This has contributed to Java's widespread adoption in various domains where portability and compatibility are essential.



// ------------------------------differences C++ and Java---------------
// 1. C++ is designed to work with compiler only while Java can support both compiler and interpreter
// 2. C++ is a procedural language while Java is an object-oriented language
// 3. C++ is a compiled language while Java is an interpreted language
// 4. C++ is a statically typed language while Java is a dynamically typed language
// 5. C++ is a general purpose language while Java is a programming language designed for developing applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
// 6.Platform dependent while Java is platform independent
// 7.C++ is a combination of OOPs and Procedural type of programming while Supports only Object-Oriented Programming style 
// 8. C++ can provide multiple inheritances while Java cannot support multiple inheritances


// ------------------------------JDK--------------------------
// JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It is a software development kit used by Java developers to create Java applications, applets, and components. The JDK includes tools and libraries necessary for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java programs.

// Java Compiler: The JDK includes the Java compiler (javac), which is used to compile Java source code files (.java) into bytecode files (.class) that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

// Java Runtime Environment (JRE): The JDK includes the JRE, which is required to run Java applications. The JRE consists of the JVM and the Java class libraries, which provide the core functionality of the Java platform.

// The JDK is essential for Java developers as it provides everything needed to develop, compile, and run Java applications. Additionally, it includes tools for managing dependencies, packaging applications, and documenting code, making it a complete development environment for Java programming.



// ------------------------------JRE--------------------------
// JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is a crucial component of the Java Platform, which provides the minimum requirements for executing Java applications or applets.

// Java Virtual Machine (JVM): This is the runtime engine that executes Java bytecode. It interprets the bytecode or, in some cases, just-in-time (JIT) compiles it into native machine code for execution on the host platform.

// Core libraries: These are the essential libraries that provide fundamental functionalities to Java applications. They include classes and methods for tasks such as input/output operations, networking, data structures, concurrency, and more.

// Supporting files and resources: The JRE also includes various configuration files, support files, and resources required for the proper functioning of Java applications.

// The JRE does not include development tools such as compilers or debuggers; it's meant purely for running Java applications. Developers, however, need the JDK (Java Development Kit), which includes the JRE along with additional tools like the Java compiler (javac), debugger, and other development utilities.

// When you install Java on your system, you typically install the JRE. It allows you to run Java applications directly without needing to do any development work. However, if you plan to develop Java applications, you would install the JDK, which includes the JRE as well as development tools.


// ------------------------------JVM--------------------------

// The JVM, or Java Virtual Machine, is a key component of the Java platform. It is an abstract computing machine that enables Java bytecode to be executed on different hardware platforms without modification.

// JVM works:

// Loading and Verifying: When a Java program is executed, the JVM loads the bytecode generated by the Java compiler. Before executing the bytecode, the JVM verifies it to ensure that it adheres to certain security and structural constraints, helping to prevent potential runtime errors and security vulnerabilities.

// Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Once the bytecode is verified, the JVM can either interpret it directly or use a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to translate the bytecode into native machine code for the host system. JIT compilation improves performance by dynamically optimizing frequently executed code segments.

// Execution: The JVM executes the bytecode, managing memory allocation, garbage collection, exception handling, and other runtime tasks. It provides a runtime environment that shields the Java program from the underlying hardware and operating system complexities.

// Garbage Collection: One of the JVM's critical tasks is managing memory allocation and deallocation. It includes an automatic memory management system known as garbage collection, which automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks and manual memory management errors.

// Platform Independence: The JVM abstracts away hardware and operating system specifics, providing a consistent execution environment for Java programs across different platforms. This allows Java programs to be written once and run on any system with a compatible JVM, adhering to the "write once, run anywhere" principle.

// Overall, the JVM plays a crucial role in making Java a platform-independent language by providing a uniform execution environment and handling various runtime tasks, enabling developers to focus on writing portable Java code.
